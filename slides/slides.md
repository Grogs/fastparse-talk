## An Introduction to Fastparse

Greg Dorrell  


FastParse is a Scala library for creating parsers
Note:
Recently I used it at work and found it really pleasant to use, so I thought I'd talk about it.


A parser takes text and turns it into structured data


Regex gets ugly quickly
Note:
- Regex is nice for validating strings, and manipulating them
- Not great for turning them into structured data
- Gets horrible to read quickly, especially if you're dealing with nested structures


Parser Generators  
<small>like LEX and YACC</small>
Note:
- AKA Compiler compilers - these do code generation
- Back at uni where I used lex and yacc to build a C-like language
- They were pretty awkward to use. 
- I had to learn a "metalanguage"/DSL for lexing and parsing
- I had to use C ðŸ¤ž


FastParse
Note:
- It's a library written by Li Haoyi
- It allows us to create recursive descent parsers
- With recursive descent parsers we can define simple parsers and then compose them to form one big parser
- FastParse provides a nice DSL to defining and compose these parsers
- Let's dig into FastParse, its' syntax, and its' features a bit, using an example from my work:



### Motivation
Note:
- I work in the Growth Tech team at Vrbo (part of Expedia Group)
- I'm very much an application developer, not a programming language author, or even really a library author. 
- So why would I be creating a parser?
- It's not to implement some general purpose language, or parse existing languages like JSON/SQL
- Well, we ended up using it one of our systems to allow our users to create links
- We created a DSL for them.



### Domain Specific Languages
Note:
- For my team, a compelling usecase was creating a DSL for our users.
- So let's talk about DSLs a little 


There's two types of DSLs


Internal DSLs
Note:
As a Scala developer you already use lots of internal DSLs


Examples:
- ScalaTest
- SBT
- Akka Streams Graph DSL
- akka-http routing DSL.
- Free Monads/Tagless Final
Note:
- With ScalaTest you have a DSL for matchers, and different testing styles (e.g. WordSpec) which each have their own DSLs for defining and structuring tests
- With SBT; it's scala, but you have a DSL for creating projects and updating settings which doesn't look too much Scala code
- akka-http, and finch which we use at work, provide DSLs for creating HTTP services
- If you use techniques like Tagless Final or Free Monads, you're essentially allowing yourself to write programs in a really nice human-readable DSL and letting the interpreter worry about what needs to happen


External DSLs

Note:
You're also using lots of those.


Examples:

- regex
- SQL
- CSS


Internal vs External
Note:
- Internal DSLs are embedded in a language. 
- What's cool about that is you have access to the full power of the languageâ€¦ But, you run code written against an internal DSL, you need runtime for the underlying language. You're generally expected to know that underlying language.
- External DSLs are much more limited. They're often declaritive and simple to use, especially for non-technical users.



## Example DSL
Note:
- Were recently used FastParse to provide a DSL for our users.
- Let's take a look at what the problem was, and how we used FastParse to solve it.

| Destination ID |
|----------------|
| 1              |
| 2              |
| 3              |

Note:
Our users provide a table of destination IDs to generate links for


### Link Templates - Before

|Text|URL|
|----|---|
|Compare holiday rentals in {destination}|/d/{destination_id}|
|Pet friendly holiday rentals in {destination}|/search/keywords:{destination_keyword}?petIncluded=true|

Note:
- This is what we had before. Our users could specify "for each destination, generate a link with this text and this relative URL" by providing these two tables
- The Text has variables in it, and the "URL"s are a URL fragment which we can concate to form a URL


### Link Templates - After

|Text|URL|
|----|---|
|Compare holiday rentals in {destination}|LandingPage|
|Pet friendly holiday rentals in {destination}|SearchPage(petIncluded=true)|

Note:
- We introduced a DSL for specifying the URLs
- This DSL is more human readable than URL suffix's
- We can turn this into structured data that's nicer to work with than string concatination
- Only valid URLs can be specified and generated
- Hopefully easier to author for our users, or at least harder to make mistakes
- As we're generating structred data, we can do fancy stuff like "ensure we have some pet friendly vacation rentals in that destination" otherwise don't generate a link.

### Summary
Note:
- FastParse let's you create parsers.
- It's nice to use, the DSL is weird at first, but good!
- It's really fast. You can write a JSON parser that's as fast as hand written JSON parsers. (see http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/Fastparse2EvenFasterScalaParserCombinators.html#performance)
- You get nice error messages, basically for free
- And it can useful for application developers!
- If you find yourself doing horrible things with regex, or building systems for power users where a DSL might be useful, consider FastParse
