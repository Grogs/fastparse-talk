## An Introduction to Fastparse

Greg Dorrell  


FastParse is a Scala library for creating parsers
Note:
Recently I used it at work and found it really pleasant to use, so I thought I'd talk about it.


A parser takes text and turns it into structured data
Note:
- What is a parser
- ...
- I first learnt about recursive descent parsers back at uni where I used lex and yacc to build a C-like language
- They were pretty awkward to use, they were written in C, and I had to learn a "metalanguage"/DSL for lexing an parsing


FastParse is a recursive descent parser
Note:
- Let's dig into FastParse, its' syntax, and its' features a bit, using an example from my work:
  - Written by Li Haoyi.
  - An improvement on parboiled and Scala's built in parser combinator library



### Usecase
Note:
- I work in the Growth Tech team at Vrbo, a market place for vacation rentals that's part of Expedia Group.
- So I'm an application developer, not a programming language author, or even really a library author. 
- So why would I be writing a parser?
- It's not to implement some general purpose language, or parse existing languages like JSON/SQL
- Well, one of our systems is a tool to empower our marketing team to create links for the destinations where we have vacation rentals
- We decided a DSL would be useful for our users.



### Domain Specific Languages
Note:
- For my team, a compelling usecasewas creating a DSL for our users.
- So let's talk about DSLs for a little bit


There's two types of DSLs


Internal DSLs
Note:
As a Scala developer you already use lots of internal DSLs


Examples:
- ScalaTest
- SBT
- Akka Streams Graph DSL
- akka-http routing DSL.
- Free Monads/Tagless Final
Note:
- With ScalaTest you have a DSL for matchers, and different testing styles (e.g. WordSpec) which each have their own DSLs for defining and structuring tests
- With SBT; it's scala, but you have a DSL for creating projects and updating settings which doesn't look too much Scala code
- akka-http, and finch which we use at work, provide DSLs for creating HTTP services


External DSLs

Note:
You're also using lots of those.


Examples:

- CSS
- SQL
- regex


Internal vs External
Note:
  - Internal DSLs are embedded in a language. What's cool about that is you have access to the full power of the languageâ€¦ But, you run code in internal DSL, you need runtime for the underlying language, you're generally expected to know that underlying language.
  - External DSLs are much more limited.



## Example DSL
Note:
- Were recently used FastParse to provide a DSL for our users.
- Let's take a look at what the problem was, and how we used FastParse to solve it.


| Destination ID |
|----------------|
| 1              |
| 2              |
| 3              |

Note:
Our users provide a table of destination IDs to generate links for


### URL Templates - Before

|Text|URL|
|----|---|
|Compare holiday rentals in {destination}|/d/{destination_id}|
|Pet friendly holiday rentals in {destination}|/search/keywords:{destination_keyword}?petIncluded=true|

Note:
- This is what we had before. Our users could specify "for each destination, generate a link with this text and this relative URL" by providing these two tables
- The Text has variables in it, and the "URL"s are a URL fragment which we can concate to form a URL


### URL Templates - After

|Text|URL|
|----|---|
|Compare holiday rentals in {destination}|LandingPage|
|Pet friendly holiday rentals in {destination}|SearchPage(petIncluded=true)|

Note:
- We introduced a DSL for specifying the URLs
- This DSL is more human readable than URL suffix's
- We can turn this into structured data that's nicer to work with than string concatination
- Only valid URLs can be specified and generated
- Hopefully easier to author for our users, or at least harder to make mistakes
- As we're generating structred data, we can do fancy stuff like "ensure we have some pet friendly vacation rentals in that destination" otherwise don't generate a link.




Note:
    - Dig into variable substitution/templated text
      - Simple example; but already better than what we had before (string replacement)
    - Dig into URL DSL
      - Would be quite awkward doing it with regex
      - Look at error messages
      - Compilation speed?
